# PHP User Adding & Filtering
Function add() accepts string or arrays, but no numbers or special characters (in case invalid data is passed to it, the function just doesn't add it).

Function getSpecialUser() returns the last name of the special user (which is determined on sorting the array of users in alphabetical order, by their first names).

Tests are included.
